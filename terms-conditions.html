                            <p>
                                The Platform constitutes an online networking platform on which the Members can create
                                and post Adverts for Trips for the purposes of carpooling. These Adverts can notably be
                                viewed by the other Members to find out the terms of the Trip, and where applicable, to
                                directly book a Seat in the vehicle in question with the Member having posted the Advert
                                on the Platform.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In using the Platform and in accepting these T&Cs, you recognize that Rafeeq is not
                                party to any agreement entered into between you and the other Members with a view to
                                sharing the costs relating to a Trip.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rafeeq has no control over the behavior of its Members and the users of the Platform. It
                                does not own, exploit, supply or manage the vehicles subject of the Adverts, and it does
                                not offer any Trips on the Platform.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You recognize and accept that Rafeeq does not control the validity, truthfulness or
                                legality of the Adverts, Seats and Trips offered. In its capacity of carpooling
                                intermediary, Rafeeq does not provide any transport service and does not act in the
                                capacity of carrier; the role of Rafeeq is limited to facilitating access to the
                                Platform.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Members (Drivers or Passengers) act under their sole and full responsibility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In its capacity of intermediary, Rafeeq cannot be held liable for the effective
                                occurrence of a Trip, and notably owing to:

                                without notice, owing to technical maintenance, migration or update operations, or owing
